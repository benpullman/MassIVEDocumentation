The comparison workflow is designed to compare up to five results from submitted MassIVE.quant reanalyses or MSstats workflow jobs.

This tutorial will be in two major steps, selecting the jobs to compare and viewing the comparison.

## 0. Finding the workflow

The comparison workflow is [here](link), or can be found in the main workflow drop down in MassIVE as "MSstats Comparisons" as below.

## 1. Selecting jobs to compare

The MSstats comparisons workflow can compare up to five outputs of differentially expressed proteins.  These jobs can be one of two types, either 1. a reanalysis that was done offline and submitted to MassIVE or 2. an online reanalysis using the MSstats workflow.  We will attach each type in the following examples.

### 1.1 Attaching a result from data in MassIVE.quant

### 1.2 Attaching a result from a MSstats comparisons workflow

## 2. Viewing the comparison
